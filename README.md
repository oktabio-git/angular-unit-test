# angular-unit-test
Made it for training reasons, only for unit testing practices. This helped me to get the Unit Testing with Jasmine and Karma certification.

If you want to run the app, just have to install node_modules folder firs with next command.

`npm i`

After that, you have to run the json server to simulate the backend server. This one runs with next command.

`json-server --watch db.json`

Finally, you just run the `ng server` command to start the app. Just remember this is a simple Angular application, the main purpouse of the app are the specs for UT part.
